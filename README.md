# BackToBasicsMachineLearning
I'm creating this repository to showcase fundamental concepts in machine learning. Currently, my focus revolves around two key concepts: overfitting and comparing/contrasting 
the differences in inheritance between Python and C++.

=============================Overfitting in machine Learning ===============================

Overfitting is a common challenge in machine learning where a model learns to perform very well on the training data but does poorly on unseen or new data (the test data). To overcome overfitting and build more generalizable models, you can employ various techniques and strategies:

More Data: Increasing the size of your dataset can help your model generalize better. With more data, your model has a better chance of capturing the underlying patterns in the data rather than fitting noise.

Data Augmentation: If obtaining more data is not feasible, you can artificially increase the size of your dataset through data augmentation. This involves applying random transformations to your existing data, such as rotations, flips, or translations, to create new training samples.

Feature Engineering: Carefully selecting and engineering relevant features can help your model focus on important information and reduce the impact of noise. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be useful.

Regularization:

L1 and L2 Regularization: These techniques add penalty terms to the loss function to discourage the model from assigning excessively high weights to certain features. L1 regularization (Lasso) tends to produce sparse models, while L2 regularization (Ridge) tends to distribute the weights more evenly.
Dropout: Dropout is a technique used in neural networks that randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training. This helps prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or feature.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to assess your model's performance more reliably. Cross-validation helps you get a better estimate of how well your model will perform on unseen data.

Early Stopping: Monitor your model's performance on a validation set during training. If the validation loss starts to increase while the training loss continues to decrease, stop training early to prevent overfitting.

Ensemble Methods:

Bagging: Techniques like Random Forests use bagging to create multiple models and combine their predictions to reduce overfitting.
Boosting: Algorithms like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting build models sequentially, giving more weight to data points that were previously misclassified, which can help improve generalization.
Simpler Models: Consider using simpler model architectures if your dataset is not very large or complex. Simpler models are less prone to overfitting.

Pruning: In decision tree-based models, pruning involves removing branches of the tree that do not provide much predictive power. Pruning can help simplify the model and reduce overfitting.

Regularization Techniques in Neural Networks:

Batch Normalization: Normalizing the activations in neural networks can help improve training stability.
Weight Decay: In addition to L1 and L2 regularization, weight decay can be used in optimization algorithms to encourage smaller weights.
Gradient Clipping: Limit the size of gradients during training to prevent exploding gradients.
Feature Selection: Carefully select the most relevant features and eliminate irrelevant or redundant ones.

Validation Set: Use a separate validation set to monitor the model's performance during training and make decisions based on validation metrics.

Domain-specific Knowledge: Incorporate domain-specific knowledge to guide model design and feature selection.

The choice of which techniques to use depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model you are working with. It's often beneficial to experiment with different approaches and combinations of techniques to find the best way to combat overfitting in your machine learning project.
